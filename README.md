# DataShore Final Documentation

# Overview of Project
DataShore allows users to understand, explore and predict environmental data. It aims to help scientists reduce time spent in treacherous research conditions and eliminate mass amounts of money spent on research equipment. Our tool will be able to fill in missing data for oceanographic and environmental datasets that have variables that are proven to be linked based on science and regression results.
